# Installing and running Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. You should create an `.env` file in the file project root folder, with the following variables:
    
    * `REACT_APP_PORT=3000`
    * `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1`

## Running demo server

After installing dependencies, run `yarn start` to start demo server.

**The server should run on port 3000. Before running the command, please make sure the port is free of
